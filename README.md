# AnalyzingNYCsubwayData

# About this project
In this project, I will acquire data, clean it and throughout the process we will discove things about the data.

The project's purpose is to explore how the NYC's subway use and the weather on a specific day relate. For that, apart from data from the subway, we will need data about the climate on the very day.

The main points of this project are: 
- Data collection from internet;
- Data Analysis.
- Data manipulation and creation of simple graphics with Pandas.
